# IoT-And-Me
A Mozfest Gallery designed to educate people on how your interactions with your devices allow for organisations to obtain data about you, and predict the type of person that you are. Me and 4 others created a Machine Learning Algorithm with individual devices, an Alexa, Phillips Hue, Spotify Sound System and an Arduinio that simulates a Smart Fridge.
Through doing this, we use the data from the interactions with these devices to determine their personality type, taking inspiration from the Myers-Briggs Personality Test and having 16 different personalities that people could identify with.
